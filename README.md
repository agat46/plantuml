## How to use theme
There are a few ways you can use these themes:

1. You can clone this repo, or you could download the theme file from the repo.
By default, a theme file is named foo.puml where foo is the name of the theme.
To invoke a local theme, you have to use the following directive:
```
!theme d-white from /themes
```

2. Use the themes from a URL. Plantuml allows you to include files on the internet with this syntax:
```
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agat46/plantuml/main/themes/puml-theme-d-white.puml
```

- for better readability it's worth to chane line type:<br />
```
skinparam linetype ortho
```
